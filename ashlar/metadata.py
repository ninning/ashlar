        Tiles are considered neighboring if the overlap area of their bounding
        rectangles is greater than the `cutoff` percentile of all overlapping
        tiles. The `bias` parameter will expand or contract the rectangles for a
        more or less inclusive test.

        The default `cutoff` percentile of 50 was chosen to reject diagonally
        adjacent tiles in a regular grid. As there are slightly more up-down and
        left-right neighbors than diagonal neighbors in a grid, the 50th
        percentile will correspond to an up-down or left-right neighbor
        intersection area. Very unusual tile position collections may require
        tuning of this parameter.

        The default `bias` value of 0 will only consider strictly overlapping
        tiles. Increasing this parameter will also consider touching or even
        disjoint tiles. The typical use case for increasing `bias` is for data
        sets where neighboring stage positions just touch, but due to stage
        position error the imaged regions do have some actual overlap that can
        be registered. Specifying a small bias value will include these touching
        neighbors in the neighbors graph.
